# MacBook Refresh

This project documents refreshing a 2019 MacBook Pro to improve thermals and overall performance. The focus was basic hardware maintenance and moving to a more efficient operating system so the machine would be usable long-term.

## What I did
- Opened the MacBook and cleaned dust from the fans and internals
- Replaced old thermal paste on the CPU
- Tested thermals and stability under load
- Switched to a lighter, more efficient operating system

## Why this project
I wanted hands-on experience working with hardware, troubleshooting thermals, and making practical decisions about operating systems. This was also a way to get more comfortable working on real machines instead of just reading about it.

## Current status
The system runs cooler and is stable under load. It’s now being used as a secondary machine and learning system.

## Notes
This repo is intentionally simple and focused on the end result rather than every step along the way.
